# English_Morse__Morse_English-Translator
I had few ideas on how to approach this project. The first idea, was to utilize an existent API. I figured I could retrieve/filter the desired data from an API which would reduce the amount of work and it would easier to maintain. However, I could not find a reliable free API that allows multiple requests which led me to the second idea. The second idea, Create my own API resource then use that as the backbone of the project. 

## Features
- The ability to convert English sentences to Morse code
- The ability to convert Morse code scripts to English
- The ability to listen to Morse code sound

## Tech stack
- Javascript 
- HTML
- CSS
- Media player function

### Challenges
- Although , the project MVP was straight forward yet , I wanted to challange myself and add a cool feature that I considered to be crusial which is the ability to listen to Morse code. Morse code are usually audible. The challange was to produce an audio when the button is pressed. I made an extensive reasearch on how to utilize the audio feature in JS and I managed to tweak the code in order to achieve the intended purpose.
